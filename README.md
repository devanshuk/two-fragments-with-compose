# two-fragments-with-compose

Starting point for proof-of-concepts with a single activity containing two fragments linked
by Jetpack Navigation. The UI of each fragment is in Jetpack compose.

The App is to be entirely written in Kotlin.

`main` branch will always contain this starting point.

For each POC, branch out (but never merge).
